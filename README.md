# StudentSystem
This repositorie is a personal project made in Java 17 using Eclipse. <br/>
It was created with the idea of helping me practice the things I have been learning about Java. <br/>
The project idea was made by ChatGPT, which suggested me to make a student registration system using POO.<br/>

## Student Registration System 
Description: Develop a Java program that allows the user to perform the following operations: <br/>
1. Student Registration: Allow the user to register new students with information such as name, age, registration number, and other relevant details. <br/>
2. Student Inquiry: Allow the user to search and display information about a specific student based on their registration number. <br/>
3. List of Students: Display the complete list of all registered students. <br/>
4. Data Update: Allow the user to update the information of a student (e.g., update age, phone number, etc.). <br/>
5. Student Deletion: Allow the user to remove a student from the list of registrations. <br/>
6. Import CSV data: Allow the user to import data from a csv file. <br/>
7. Export CSV data: Allow the user to export data from a csv file. <br/>
8. Exit the program.

I will be updating the project and adding new features making use of different aspects of the Java language in the future. <br/>
